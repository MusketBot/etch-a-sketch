# etch-a-sketch
An Etch-a-Sketch web-app project that is 
structured with html, styled with 
css, and manipulated by using  javascript.

The buttons are to generate a new grid 
size and to pick between different colors. 
The 'Generate Grid" button prompts the 
user to enter a number in a pop-up box for the grid size.
Once the desired grid size is generated 
and color chosen, you can move the mouse 
over the grid to start coloring each cell 
of the grid. If the user has colored too 
much there is the “Erase” button to undo 
or the “Clear Grid” button to erase the 
whole grid without resizing it.
